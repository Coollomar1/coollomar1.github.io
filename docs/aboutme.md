## ðŸ“š **About Me**

Hi, Iâ€™m Omar Masriâ€”a dedicated and ambitious Computer Science student at Clemson University with a passion for cybersecurity, software development, and leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges. My journey is marked by academic excellence (Presidentâ€™s List for three consecutive years) and hands-on experience, from interning as a Cybersecurity Analyst to leading impactful projects in programming and data analysis. I thrive at the intersection of technical problem-solving and creativity, always eager to expand my skill set and contribute meaningfully to the tech world. I am currently expected to graduate in May of 2026, and I have successfuly maintained a 3.86 GPA up to my junior year.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I believe in living a balanced and fulfilling life. I enjoy staying active through regular workouts and cherish the joy of connecting with friends over good food. As a creative mind, I love producing content that inspires and entertains while constantly learning new things to grow personally and professionally. Iâ€™m also an avid investor, keeping a keen eye on financial trends and opportunities. Whether Iâ€™m delving into a coding project, exploring new cuisines, or simply hanging out with my closest friends, I bring curiosity, enthusiasm, and a love for new experiences to everything I do.

I'm fluent in English and Arabic, and I love meeting new cultures. Diversity is something that I would love to experience, and with my previous experiences, I have met some of my best friends who came from different backgrounds.

Letâ€™s connect and share ideasâ€”because the best stories are written when passion meets collaboration!
